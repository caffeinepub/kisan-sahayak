  "summary": "REQ-12 appears addressed via a new RemoteImage component with minimum height, loading/error handling, and a specific placeholder for Google Images search URLs. However, REQ-13 is not implemented because exportDeckToPptx.ts still generates and downloads an HTML file, not a real .pptx. REQ-14 is also not implemented because the export success toast still instructs HTML/Print-to-PDF/screenshot workflows and does not reflect a true PPTX download flow.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Replace the current HTML-based export in frontend/src/pptx/exportDeckToPptx.ts with generation of a real PowerPoint .pptx file download, embedding slide text and assigned images, preserving minimal white + blue styling and 16:9 layout.",
      "reason": "The export function still generates HTML (generateSlidesHTML), creates a Blob of type text/html, and downloads a .html file (Kisan_Sahayak_Presentation.html). No evidence in the diff summary shows PPTX file generation or embedding images into a PPTX.",

      "requirement": "Update the export UI messaging to reflect the real PPTX download flow (no HTML/PDF/screenshot references) and provide clear English success/error/warning toasts matching actual export behavior and image-embed limitations.",
      "reason": "The success toast explicitly references exporting an HTML file and instructs Print to PDF / import into PowerPoint / screenshots, which contradicts the required real PPTX download messaging.",
